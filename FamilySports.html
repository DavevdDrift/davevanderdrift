								<span id="Bold">About The Family Sports app</span></br>
								The Family Sports app has different features, such as explaining excersises, testing your BMI and news about Family Sports. However, a lot of Family Sports members aren’t using the app or don’t even know it exists. As a result, they are missing out on a lot of knowledge about exercises, information and news about the company.
								</br></br>
								Family Sports wants to change this by redesigning the app. The aim was to improve the features, user experience and visual design. The more exciting it will be to use the app, the more people will start to use it. 
								</br></br>
								<span id="Bold">The process</span></br>
								I started with research, using fieldresearch, an online survey, online analytics and a heuristic evaluation. The research showed why people like to use their phone while exercising, why people use a certain sport app, what they like and don’t like about fitness, which information they are looking for if they search for Family Sports and the most used functions in the app. 
								</br></br>
								The user needs from the research created idea’s for the concept. It was already clear that the concept would be a remake of the application. However, this could include a lot of different features. That is why several concept scenario’s have been made, to show how features could work. A moodboard was also created to give an impression of a possible designstyle. The feedback would be used during the design process.
								</br></br>
								I started making designs based on the concept scenario’s and User Needs. I started by making a sitemap, followed by wireframes. I made a lo-fi prototype from the wireframes and did tests with the target group. After that I made adjustments to the wireframes and started making hi-fi designs. I once again did tests with the target group. I also showed the design to other students and got feedback around the UI.
								</br></br>
								<span id="Bold">Result</span></br>
								The final product is a remake of the Family Sports app, as a hi-fi prototype. The application guides the user with training, nutrition and progression tracking. It also gives information about Family Sports itself.
								</br></br>
								New functions have been added, old functions have been improved, the User Experience has been improved and the visual design got an update. Because of this, the app will be better at informing the User about Family Sports, guide the user with their training, diet and it makes the user more excited to exercise.
