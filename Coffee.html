						<span id="Bold">About The baristagair app</span></br>
						During a group project we developed a learning tool for the company N-Ice.Coffee. They train people to become baristas, who find it hard to learn and practice assignments. Their current curriculum is good, however, the program is not supplemented enough outside the teaching hours. 
						</br></br>
						The goal was to design a learning tool that complements the current curriculum into a complete program. This would guarantee the knowledge and more stimulation to learn, which ensures that the students develop better self-confidence and have more fun in learning.
					</p>
				</div>

				<div class="Selfie">
					<p class="Inleiding">
						<span id="Bold">Research</span></br>
						We started this project by doing research. For this project we used an organisation analysis, in order to discover more about the company. We wanted to discover the trends the company wanted to use. In addition, a meeting was held with the client, in which questions about the organisation were asked. Deskresearch was also used in order to find out more about the company, such as their message.  
						</br></br>
						A target group analysis was used to discover the identity of the target group, including their needs and trends among the target group. We have done this with desk research and multiple interviews. With this research we discovered what we need to take into consideration for the target group, during the design phase, such as trends. Persona’s were made to get an overview of the target group.

						A concurrent analysis was used to discover how to make an effective learning tool. We’ve used deskresearch to read about the creation of other learning tools. We’ve also used a benchmark to look at other learning tools and compare their features with each other. This helped us find out what would be effective for our learning tool.
						</br></br>
						The research showed that e-learning was important to use and gave insight into the aspects that e-learning uses to offer a teaching program digitally.
 						The core values of N-Ice.Coffee were also important and had to be kept in mind when designing the concept. The style of the company was also important to include in the design process.

						<span id="Bold">Concepts</span></br>
						As a result of the research, we came up with three different concepts. These were the coffee app that supports the “coffee machine mode”, the coffee website that is comparable to the website “TheBoost” and a coffee app with all kinds of useful information, tricks that could help students in practice.
						During the concept presentation it became clear that we were going to combine these three concepts into one large concept, whereby we took the advantages of all three concepts.
						The final concept was a learning tool in the form of a mobile application.

						<span id="Bold">Designing & Testing the dating app</span></br>
						With the concept we started the design process. First, we decided the functional & non-functional system requirements. These requirements were decided based on the research and have been prioritised. After this, we made a sitemap to visualise how individual webpages or site sections are related to each other. Then we made a content plan, in order to determine what to show on a certain page. With the help of our sitemap and content plan we made sketches, wireframes, a style tile, styleguide, a hi-fi prototype and wrote accountability for our design choices. 
						</br></br>
						It was important to test our prototype. We made several changes in the design, after our tests. We used a pre-test, scenario testing and post-tests. With the help of the feedback we improved our prototype.

						<span id="Bold">Result</span></br>
						An application has been developed that serves as a learning tool. The application offers courses, among other things, which allow people to practice their knowledge. Using a scoreboard, students can achieve their own score and battle for the highest one against each other. The app rewards students and shows their progress. During the exhibition we received a standing applause from our client.
