							<span id="Bold">About The baristagair app</span></br>
							During a group project we developed a learning tool for the company N-Ice.Coffee. They train people to become baristas, who find it hard to learn and practice assignments. Their current curriculum is good, however, the program is not supplemented enough outside the teaching hours. The goal was to design a learning tool that complements the current curriculum into a complete program. This would guarantee the knowledge and more stimulation to learn, which ensures that the students develop better self-confidence and have more fun in learning.

							</br></br>
							<span id="Bold">The process</span></br>
							We started this project by doing research. For this project we used deskresearch. In addition, a meeting was held with the client, in which questions about the organization were asked. The research showed that e-learning was important to use. The research gave insight into the aspects that e-learning uses, to offer a teaching program digitally.
 							The core values were also important and had to be kept in mind when designing the concept. The style of the company was also important to include in the design process. 
							</br></br>
							We came up with three different concepts. These were the coffee app that supports the “coffee machine mode”, the coffee website that is comparable to the website “TheBoost” and a coffee app with all kinds of useful information, tricks that could help students in practice.
							During the concept presentation it became clear that we were going to combine these three concepts into one large concept, whereby we took the advantages of all three concepts.
							The final concept was a learning tool in the form of a mobile application.
							</br></br>
							With the concept we could start designing. First, we decided the functional & non-functional system requirements. After this, we made a sitemap. Then we made a content plan, in order to determine what to show on a certain page. Next up, we made sketches, wireframes, a styletyle, styleguide, a hi-fi prototype and wrote accountability for our design choices. It was important to test our prototype. We made several changes in the design, after our tests. We used a pre-test, scenario testing and post-tests.
							</br></br>
							<span id="Bold">The Result</span></br>
							An application has been developed that serves as a learning tool. The application offers courses, among other things, which allow people to practice their knowledge. Using a scoreboard, students can achieve their own score and battle for the highest one against each other. The app rewards students and shows their progress. During the exhibition we received a standing applause from our client.
