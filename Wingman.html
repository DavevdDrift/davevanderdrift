						<span id="Bold">About The Wingman app</span></br>
						For this group project we made a new dating application. There are few differences between available dating applications, when matching users. Users are often judged on their photos. There is insufficient insight into a new way of dating, which focuses on aspects other than visual material. There is also insufficient insight into the functional possibilities of sensors in a smartphone. 
						</br></br>
						The goal was to provide insight into new ways to match users with the same interests. This includes the functional possibilities of sensors in a smartphone, with regard to the experience of users of a dating application. These sensors had to contribute to the match process.
					</p>

						<span id="Bold">Research</span></br>
						We started this project by doing research. We started with a concurrent analysis to gather inspiration of the market with dating apps, to get a better view of the qualities that our concurrents offer. 					    
						</br></br>
						We’ve done a benchmark to get a better insight and view of the features that our concurrents offer. The benchmark showed us an overview of the features that direct and indirect concurrents offer. Because of this we could compare their features with each other.
						</br></br>
						A target group research has been used to gather experiences that the target group has with dating applications. This was done with the help of an online form. As a result, we discovered opinions about features of dating apps.
						</br></br>
						In-depth interviews were used to gather specific and extended insights of the target group. During the interview we talked about their experiences, feeling of security, features, privacy and if the applications that they used were effective in finding a match.
						</br></br>
						We made persona’s and an empathy map, to get a clear overview and a better insight of the data that we have gathered with our research about the target group. Because of our large target group, we made three different persona’s that represent our target group. The empathy map complements the persona’s by representing who the user is, does, sees, hears and what behaviour is stimulated when using a dating app.

						With the help of our research we discovered user needs that show an overview of the wishes the target group has. The user needs helped us to set up user stories with acceptance criteria. They will serve as a handle during the design process. 					    
						</br></br>
						The research showed the biggest concurrents, how they were positioned, what experiences people have with dating apps and what their experiences are with dating apps. The user stories and acceptance criteria provided the needs of the target group.

						<span id="Bold">Concept scenario’s</span></br>
						With the help of our research, we made multiple concepts based on the user needs and acceptation criteria that our target group had. The needs of the target group have resulted in six concept scenarios. These scenarios show the functional possibilities for the target audience, while using a dating application. 				    
						</br></br>
						We presented these concepts to students to gather feedback. During the presentation we talked about our concepts with the help of different scenarios. After the presentation the students gave us feedback, by filling in an online form. Their feedback gave us multiple insights that helped us improve our concept during the design phase.

						<span id="Bold">Designing & testing the dating app</span></br>
						With our concept in mind, we started to design.  With the help of the user flow, site map and customer journey map we gathered inspiration and mapped the interaction between the system and the user. The style guide provided a clear style and hierarchy in the application. The patterns, design principles and system requirements have helped to support the visual elaboration. The wireframes provided a first impression of the application, enabling the hi-fi prototype to be realised. 					    
						</br></br>
						The hi-fi prototypes were tested with the target group during usability tests, as soon as the first designs were made. We used scenario testing for the usability tests. The feedback that we got helped us improve the interface and user experience of our dating app.

						<span id="Bold">Result</span></br>
						We developed a dating application that can be used to find people with the same hobbies. A buddy system is also used for this. Which is a built-in AI, which helps the user in making choices and taking steps, in order to create the best possible match and result.
