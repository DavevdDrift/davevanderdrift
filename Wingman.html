							<span id="Bold">About The Wingman app</span></br>
							For this group project we made a new dating application. There are few differences between available dating applications, when matching users. Users are often judged on their photos. There is insufficient insight into a new way of dating, which focuses on aspects other than visual material. There is also insufficient insight into the functional possibilities of sensors in a smartphone. The goal was to provide insight, into new ways to match users with the same interests. This includes the functional possibilities of sensors in a smartphone, with regard to the experience of users of a dating application. These sensors had to contribute to the match process.
							</br></br>
							<span id="Bold">The process</span></br>
							We started making a dating app by doing research. In order to research we used a competition analysis, benchmark,  research target group, in-depth interviews, personas, empathy map, User needs and concept scenarios. The research showed the biggest concurrents, how they were positioned, what experiences people have with dating apps and what their experiences are with dating apps. The user stories and acceptance criteria provided the needs of the target group. 
							</br></br>
							The needs of the target group have resulted in six concept scenarios. These scenario’s show the functional possibilities for the target audience, while using a dating application. This concept is elaborated in the next phase, the design report.
							</br></br>
							With our concept in mind, we started to design. The user flow, site map and customer journey map have been used for inspiration and to map the interaction between the system and the user. The style guide provided a clear style and hierarchy in the application. The patterns, design principles and system requirements have helped to support the visual elaboration. The wireframes provided a first impression of the application, enabling the High-Fi prototype to be realised. The usability test has provided new insights that have been implemented in the High-Fi prototype.
							</br></br>										
							<span id="Bold">Result</span></br>
							We developed a dating application that can be used to find people with the same hobbies. A buddy system is also used for this. Which is a built-in AI, which helps the user in making choices and taking steps, in order to create the best possible match and result.
