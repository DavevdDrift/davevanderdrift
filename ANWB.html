								<span id="Bold">About The ANWB Onderweg app</span></br>
								During my internship at the ANWB I worked on improving the ANWB Onderweg app. This is a mobile application that offers functions regarding traffic, parking and refueling. The average age of ANWB app users is around 55 years of age or higher. The ANWB has a need to be relevant for a younger target group, around the age of 35. My task was to create a proposal on how the ANWB Onderweg app could become more attractive for a younger target audience. Together with the Scrum team I made improvements on the current design and I designed a new function for the app called Ontrip.
								</br></br>
								<span id="Bold">The Process</span></br>
								I started to create a proposal by doing research. I did in-depth qualitative interviews, dairy studies, a concurrent analysis, a benchmark and a trendresearch. The research showed which applications were popular, if they use things like a physical map or an app, why they like certain traffic apps, why they don’t use the ANWB apps and their proposals on how to improve the app. The research showed that the app would become more popular, if a routenavigation would be added.
								</br></br>
								I came up with a concept, where the current features of the app could be used safely, while the user is driving with routenavigation and guidance. The idea was to switch between the features. For example, you could enable the traffic filter for traffic information such as traffic jams, enable the Parking Tab when you are looking for a nearby parking space and the fuel tab when you have to drive past a gas station.
								</br></br>
								With the concept in mind, I started designing in Sketch. The house style of the ANWB was available in Zeplin and eventually in their own design system, called Poncho. It was important that everything could be seen or done in 3 seconds. If the user would stare at the screen for a longer time, trying to understand the screen, it would result in dangerous situations. I made multiple versions and I did tests with people who worked at the ANWB. In these tests, I showed the hi-fi prototype and asked for feedback, while asking questions.
								</br></br> 
								<span id="Bold">The Result</span></br>
								The final product is a new feature in the ANWB Onderweg app, as a hi-fi prototype. With Ontrip you can safely use the current features in the app, while driving on the road, in combination with route navigation and guidance. It is a combination of navigation apps and features of The Onderweg app 
								</br></br>
								<span id="Bold">Conclusion</span></br>
								Young people will use the app more when route navigation and route guidance is available. The ANWB and the young people would like to have a function in the app called Ontrip. With Ontrip you can safely use the current functions in the app while driving on the raod, in combination with route navigation and guidance.
