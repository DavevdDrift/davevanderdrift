						<span id="Bold">About The ANWB Onderweg app</span></br>
						 During my internship at the ANWB I worked on improving the ANWB Onderweg app. This is a mobile application that offers functions regarding traffic, parking and refuelling. The average age of ANWB app users is around 55 years of age or higher. The ANWB has a need to be relevant for a younger target group, around the age of 35. 
						</br></br>
						My task was to create a proposal on how the ANWB Onderweg app could become more attractive for a younger target audience. Together with the Scrum team I made improvements on the current design and I designed a new feature for the app called Ontrip.				    
						</br></br>
					</p>

						<span id="Bold">Research</span></br>
						I started to create a proposal by doing research. I did in-depth qualitative interviews with the target group, in order to gather specific and broad insights about navigation, mobility applications and the ANWB (app) itself.
						</br></br>
						I’ve done diary studies to get a better insight of experiences in their daily life of the target group, in terms of traffic, parking and refuelling. This diary study consisted of 5 days, to get an overview of the whole work week.
						</br></br>
						I’ve done a concurrent analysis, to gather information and inspiration on how the applications of the competitors work
						and why they are used by the target group. The competitive analysis is intended to gain inspiration about the mobility market
						applications, in order to get a better picture of the qualities of competitors. 
						</br></br>
						With the help of a benchmark, I could compare the features of the most important concurrents. I looked at what features certain apps have or don’t have and how these features have been implemented. This helped to look at which features could potentially be added into the app. 
						</br></br>
						A trend research has also been used to look for special features around traffic, parking and refuelling, which are popular among the target group. 
						</br></br>
						The research showed which applications were popular, if they use things like a physical map or an app, why they like certain traffic apps, why they don’t use the ANWB apps and their proposals on how to improve the app. The research showed that the app would become more popular, if a route navigation would be added.

						<span id="Bold">Concepts</span></br>
						With the help of the research and conversations with the team, I came up with a concept, where the current features of the app could be used safely, while the user is driving with route navigation and guidance. The idea was to switch between the features. For example, you could enable the traffic filter for traffic information such as traffic jams, enable the Parking Tab when you are looking for a nearby parking space and the fuel tab when you have to drive past a gas station.

						<span id="Bold">Designing & testing the Ontrip feature</span></br>
						With the concept in mind, I started designing in Sketch. The corporate identity of the ANWB was available in Zeplin and eventually in their own design system, called Poncho. 
						</br></br>
						During the design process, it was important to design from the perspective of a driving user. For example, it was important that everything could be seen or done in 3 seconds. If the user would stare at the screen for a longer time, trying to understand the screen, it would result in dangerous situations. 
						</br></br>
						I made multiple versions and I did tests with people who worked at the ANWB. In these tests, I showed the hi-fi prototype and asked for feedback, while asking certain questions in context of the Ontrip feature and observing how they use this feature.

						<span id="Bold">The Result</span></br>
						The final product is a new feature in the ANWB Onderweg app, as a hi-fi prototype. With Ontrip you can safely use the current features in the app, while driving on the road, in combination with route navigation and guidance. It is a combination of navigation apps and features of The Onderweg app
